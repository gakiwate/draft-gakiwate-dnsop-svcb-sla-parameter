               Service Binding Mapping for Service Levels
             draft-gakiwate-dnsop-svcb-sla-parameter-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a new SvcParamKey for use in Service Binding
   (SVCB) and HTTPS DNS resource records which enables authoritative DNS
   servers to indicate that a service should be used by clients having
   specific service levels or use types, such as "interactive",
   "background" or "realtime".  By providing this information, clients
   can make informed decisions about which service endpoints to use
   based on specific applications needs at that time of making
   connections.

1.  Introduction

   The SVCB and HTTPS resource records (RRs) provide clients with
   instructions to connect to a service while avoiding transient
   connections to a suboptimal default server [SVCB].  However, there
   are scenarios in which a server deployment might want client
   applications to interact differently with the service based on the
   specific client needs at the time.  Traditionally, the solution to
   this problem has been to create separate services --- one for
   "interactive" tasks and another for "background" tasks.  However,
   there are scenarios where a service with a single hostname needs to
   be used by both "background" and "interactive" clients.

   The document defines a new SvcParamKey "sla", short for Service Level
   Attribute, to provide a standardized way for a client to dynamically
   discover different service endpoints offering different service
   levels using SVCB / HTTPS RRs.  This parameters allows client
   applications to filter out which services apply to them at the time
   of using DNS answers to establish connections.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Motivation

   In modern network environments, deployment scenarios often involve
   diverse application traffic types, such as interactive video
   conferencing, real-time gaming, and background file synchronization,
   each with distinct performance requirements.  Interactive traffic
   typically demands low latency and high responsiveness, while
   background traffic prioritizes throughput and efficiency over
   immediacy.  Moreover, where in the network enviornment these demands
   can be relaibly and efficiently met also differ.

   The "sla" SvcParamKey enables authoritative DNS servers to signal
   these distinctions, thereby allowing clients to route traffic
   intelligently.  This capability is particularly useful in load-
   balancing scenarios, where providers can allocate interactive traffic
   to low-latency, high-performance servers while directing background
   tasks to cost-effective, lower-performance infrastructure.

   Allowing clients explicit control over which service level to use
   benefits a range of stakeholders, including service operators, by
   improving quality of service (QoS), optimizing resource utilization,
   and enhancing end-user experience.

4.  The "sla" SvcParamKey

   The "sla" SvcParamKey, short for Service Level Attribute, is used to
   indicate that a service described in SVCB RR supports a specific
   service level use type.  A endpoint can support multiple service
   levels.  To support multiple service level types at different
   endpoints, multiple SVCB / HTTPS RRs SHOULD be used.

   The presentation value for "sla" SHALL be a comma-seperated list of
   one or more integers (1-octet) indicating the service level use.  A
   service endpoint may serve more than one service level.  A lower
   value indicates a more cost-effective, lower-performance endpoint
   while a higher value indicates a low-latency, high-performance
   endpoint.  A sla=0 can be thought of as a endpoint supporting
   "background" tasks such as performing backups.  A sla=1 can be
   thought of as a endpoint supporting "interactive" tasks such sending
   messages, while a sla=2 can be thought of as a endpoint supporting
   "real-time" tasks such as invoking a voice assistant.  This documents
   defines three service levels, and restricts the values of sla to 0,
   1, or 2.  Future documents may choose to extend this number.

   The wire format for the "sla" parameter is a sequence of service
   levels each denoted by a 1-octet numeric.

4.1.  Client Behavior

   The "sla" SvcParamKey in the SVCB / HTTPS records indicates that the
   domain owner recommends the use a specific endpoint for a specific
   service level use type.  On receiving RRs with the "sla" SvcParamKey,
   clients SHOULD use it as a filter to decide which RRs to use when.
   Since this document only defines three service levels, a client
   SHOULD ignore any SVCB RRs with an "sla" value greater than 2.  It is
   possible that certain RRs are never used by some clients.

   To use the SVCB / HTTPS RRs, the client first determines its service
   level.  The client then filters down to only SVCB / HTTPS RRs that
   match its own perceived service level.  A SVCB / HTTPS RR is
   considered to match if any of the "sla" values associated match the
   client's service level.  A RR without a "sla" value is considered
   equivalent to sla=0,1,2 and thus matches all client service levels.

   Once the client filters SVCB / HTTPS RRs to ones that offer the
   service level it desires, the client proceeds with processing the
   remaining SVCB / HTTPS RRs as normal.  If no RRs match, SVCB
   resolution has failed, and the list of available endpoints is empty.
   To prevent this behavior, service operators SHOULD ensure that the
   complete set of SVCB RRs contains all "sla" levels; this can be done
   either by having each level explicitly in some SVCB RR, or by having
   a SVCB RR that does not contain the "sla" parameter.

4.2.  Example Use

   A service that supports "interactive" and "background" endpoints can
   signal support to the client by populating SVCB / HTTPS RRs as so:

   svc.example.com 7200 IN SVCB 1 background.svc.example.com (
       alpn=h2, sla=0, mandatory=sla )
   svc.example.com 7200 IN SVCB 1 interactive.svc.example.com (
       alpn=h2, sla=1,2 )

   In the above example, a client that determines it wants a "realtime"
   (sla=2) service level will first filter for RRs with an sla value of
   2.  In this case, only one RR satisfies the constraint and the client
   can use interactive.svc.example.com endpoint.  The service operator
   can also use the mandatory flag for the background service, so that
   clients who do not support the "sla" SvcParamKey default to their
   endpoint of choice.

   A service operator can also have the same service level offered at
   multiple service endpoints, as seen in the following example:

   svc.example.com 7200 IN SVCB 1 interactive.svc.example.com (
       alpn=h2, sla=1 )
   svc.example.com 7200 IN SVCB 2 . (
       alpn=h2, sla=0,1,2 )

   With this additional RR, a client that determines its application has
   an "interactive" (sla=1) service level will match both RRs.  After
   allowing both of these RRs, the client will the proceed to process
   the RRs as before.  In this case, since the RRs have different
   SvcPriority levels, the client will prefer
   "interactive.svc.example.com".

6.1.  SVCB Service Parameter

   Once standardized, this document would ask to add the following entry
   to the "Service Parameter Keys (SvcParamKeys)" registry.

     +========+======+===============+===================+===========+
     | Number | Name | Meaning       | Change Controller | Reference |
     +========+======+===============+===================+===========+
     | TBD    | sla  | Service Level |                   | (this     |
     |        |      | Attribute     |                   | document) |
     +--------+------+---------------+-------------------+-----------+
